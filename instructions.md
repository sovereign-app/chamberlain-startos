# Instructions

Specify a URL for how the mint should be reachable. If your node is not
reachable from the internet, you can configure the [sovereign.app](https://sovereign.app) integration. 

By default, the mint will use the TOR url provided by the main interface.

## sovereign.app Integration

Enabling the [sovereign.app](https://sovereign.app) integration will allow your mint to be accessible over the internet. 
This is the easiest way to make your mint accessible to others.

During the configuration setup, enable the integration. A code will be generated that you can use to link your 
[sovereign.app](https://sovereign.app) account to your mint. Use the wallet app to enter the code and link your mint.

### Wallet

Download [sovereign.app](https://sovereign.app) for an easy to use integrated
wallet.
