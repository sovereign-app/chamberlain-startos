# Instructions

Specify a URL for how the mint should be reachable. If your node is not
reachable from the internet, you can configure NWS. If you are unsure how to
generate the correct NWS URL, use an initial dummy value, then use the `.nostr`
URL generated in the logs.

## NWS Integration

To enable NWS, configure the hex version of your Nostr private key and a relay
to broadcast your service (i.e., `wss://relay.sovereign.app`).

## Wallet

Download [sovereign.app](https://sovereign.app) for an easy to use integrated
wallet.
